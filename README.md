# expression
A drop in contact message form for websites

## background
On most websites you will find that there is a "Leave us a message" form.

The form usually has a set of fields namely:
- name 
- email
- phone
- message

Instead of writing code each time you want to have this functionality , <b>expression</b>  allows you to just drop in this form and add your API endpoint for storing the form
